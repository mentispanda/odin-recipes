        <p>Learn how to make this classic coffee cocktail. Our easy recipe uses freshly brewed espresso, a dash of coffee liqueur and a simple sugar syrup.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>ice</li>
            <li>100ml vodka</li>
            <li>50ml freshly brewed espresso coffee</li>
            <li>50ml coffee liqueur (we used Kahlua)</li>
            <li>4 coffee beans (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the sugar syrup. Put the caster sugar in a small pan over a medium heat and pour in 50ml water. Stir, and bring to the boil.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool. Put 2 martini glasses in the fridge to chill.</li>
            <li>Once the sugar syrup is cold, pour 1 tbsp into a cocktail shaker along with a handful of ice, the vodka, espresso and coffee liqueur. Shake until the outside of the cocktail shaker feels icy cold.</li>
            <li>Strain into the chilled glasses. Garnish each one with coffee beans if you like.</li>
